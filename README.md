# Violet UI
It's the UI Toolkit project for all snappfood projects. (from now on of course :D)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Start 
In order to start the project, first be sure that your port 3000 is clear.

```

Then
```
yarn start // or npm
```
and you should see the project page started in the main page. 

**Note**: Playground and tests isn't ready yet, coming soon!
